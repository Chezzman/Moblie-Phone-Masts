changing to pandas for more table control... this also means I will be programming more in python

I have set up the static fiels for bootstrap and future javascript and css files

need to:
send csv data to page and not just be the page,
then manipulate data for test paramiters
   - list sorted by lease amount in ascending order
          df = pd.read_csv("D:\MAIN\CODE\Mobile_Phone_Masts_Data\Moblie-Phone-Masts\mobile_masts\mobile_phone_masts.csv")#qs.to_dataframe()
          df = df.sort_values(by='Current Rent')


   - display the first 5 results in a table that can then be toggled between ascending/decending value
        df = df.head(5)

Add a form to add to data base that converts to csv with pandas(new entries must meet the lease amount requirements)
put form on index html at bottom of the table

display total rent for all items in this page List



add css to what I like
use es6 for user experence

Test functions for form and producing the table data




Potentially have model data displayed for each tenant_name

need to make javascript or other classes that will be added to the html on press for sorting tables


working theiory for dictionary

  df = pd.read_csv("D:\MAIN\CODE\Mobile_Phone_Masts_Data\Moblie-Phone-Masts\mobile_masts\mobile_phone_masts.csv", dtype='category')
  df = pd.Series(pd.Categorical(["Arqiva Services ltd", "Tenant Name"], categories=["Arqiva Services ltd", "Arqiva Ltd", "Vodafone Ltd", "O2 (UK) Ltd", "Hutchinson3G Uk Ltd", "Everything Everywhere Ltd", "Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure"]))
  df.value_counts()
