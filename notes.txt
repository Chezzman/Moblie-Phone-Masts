changing to pandas for more table control... this also means I will be programming more in python

I have set up the static fiels for bootstrap and future javascript and css files

need to:
send csv data to page and not just be the page,
then manipulate data for test paramiters


Add a form to add to data base that converts to csv with pandas(new entries must meet the lease amount requirements)
put form on index html at bottom of the table



add css to what I like
use es6 for user experience

Test functions for form and producing the table data


working theiory for dictionary

  df = pd.read_csv("D:\MAIN\CODE\Mobile_Phone_Masts_Data\Moblie-Phone-Masts\mobile_masts\mobile_phone_masts.csv", dtype='category')
  df = pd.Series(pd.Categorical(["Arqiva Services ltd", "Tenant Name"], categories=["Arqiva Services ltd", "Arqiva Ltd", "Vodafone Ltd", "O2 (UK) Ltd", "Hutchinson3G Uk Ltd", "Everything Everywhere Ltd", "Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure"]))
  df.value_counts()
