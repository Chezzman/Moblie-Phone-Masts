This was a tech test to show my ability in languages I have already covered before, however during the starting stages of this task I felt that my code was not clean and thus provided some complication. From this I found Pandas, an old but viable package to provide more control over the analytical data.

The requirements were to develop a Web app that uses a comma separated value(CSV) spread sheet from Mobile Phone Mast/leeds/02.09.2016. The various tasks asked involved reading data into the front end, manipulate the data to show certain results from the table, and finally make a Post request and add to the table.

In this I have used Django, Html and bootstrap. Due to my previous experiences in front end I decided to spend more of my time with Python and learning pandas to utilizing the table manipulation mechanics . Even though it was basic request functions with little to know 'if' statements for user experience, I found it more pertinent to understand the fundamentals from these tools. With foresight being everything I would have chosen flask and Jinja, due to my current knowledge this would have improved links between the front and back end, to potentially speed the development of the requirements as well.

Requirements:
1)Read in data with current rent in ascending order : TICK
2)Display top 5 results, value can be toggled between ascending/descending value
3)new entry and update front End
4)Display a total rent of all items
5)create a dictionary
